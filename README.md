# Temperature_Anomaly_Analysis
This project analyzes global temperature anomalies over the years, specifically focusing on the period 2015-2019. The dataset used contains temperature deviations from the climatological baseline (1981-2000). The goal is to visualize and annotate the data effectively using Python.
